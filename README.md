# Kits

Repo with code of all Kits as this code is sheared between them every kit as it own branch.

This is code for *res://addons/kit_name/*, should be used as git submodule.

If want want to work on your own Rakugo Kit you should fork existing one or start from [KitTemplate](https://github.com/rakugoteam/KitTemplate)

After that if you want you can:
- create your own branch for your kit submodule
- or unset *res://addons/kit_name/* from being submodule

To see any code please switch to kit branch.
